# ✨OpenNT✨ (thank you gamut)


This is an OpenGL project that I am creating to just mess around with and hopfully turn into something cool! Whether that ends up being a super basic game, somthing bigger, or not even a game at all is still yet to be decided. 

This repository is primarily to track my own progress as well as organize my thoughts about it. 

If you'd like to keep up with my OpenGL improvement, then this is where I'll be putting it until it becomes something bigger (if it ever does)!

### Goals (Expect to change)

* Create a game/game engine/render engine (something along those lines)

* Implement the math myself without the help of any math libraries like GLM

* Gain a general understanding of how rendering and game development works

* Use my own assets including textures and models (and maybe sounds?)

* Gain a more advanced understanding of GLSL

* Become proficient in C++

### TODO (in no particular order)

* Learn CMake and create a CMake file for this project

* Generally better efficiency (eg. use shallow copies instead of deep copies to reduce number of operations, more efficient math algorithms)

* Create model/mesh abstractions so I don't have to deal with all the VAO and model matrix math every draw call

* More advanced shaders and implement simple lighting (currently going with a 2.5D style, so learn how to use normal mapping?)

* Create a resource management system

* Accept user input and a moveable camera
